Suppose we there's no any edge ant the beginning, and we're going to add them one by one.
At the beginning we have same number of connected components and vertexes. After adding one edge the number of connected components decreases by one or does not change. 
Suppose there's no cycles in our graph, and it means that each new edge will reduce number of connected components. In order to get 1 connected component, we need to add n-1 edges, otherwise there will be more than one connected component.
